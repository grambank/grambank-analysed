#script written by Hedvig Skirg√•rd

#this scripts compares the coverage of features per language in WALS and Grambank and produces a plot. The data is standardized such that dialects are aggregated into languages for both datasets to make a more accurate comparison. WALS languoids which lack glottocodes are not included in the comparison.
